Triple-A is a testing tool designed to help you structure your tests in a sensible way. It is directly based on the "AAA" or Arrange/Act/Assert testing approach, and carries a philosophy:

1. Only test one thing at a time
2. Order of test implementation facilitates communication
3. More, descriptive tests is better
4. Isolated tests are best

Triple-A is opinionated because that's what it's for.
